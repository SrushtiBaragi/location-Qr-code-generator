# location-Qr-code-generator
This project is a Python-based tool that generates QR codes for any location. Users can enter a Google Maps link or latitude/longitude coordinates, and the program creates a scannable QR code image. When scanned, the QR code directly opens the specified location in Google Maps. The program also automatically saves the QR code image and can open it.
